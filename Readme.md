## 📢 About the Project

Clue is a benchmarking and observability framework for gathering and compiling sustainability and quality reports on changes in cloud-native applications.

It can be used as part of your CI/CD pipeline to evaluate the impact of changes or as a standalone tool to evaluate prototypes you are working on.

The framework is designed to be extensible and can be easily integrated with existing cloud providers. We currently rely on Prometheus to collect all relevant metrics, but we are working on adding support for other monitoring tools.
Moreover, we are currently focusing on Kubernetes as the orchestrator, so as long as your application runs on Kubernetes, you can use Clue to evaluate it. However, we are working on adding support for other environments as well.

This Readme describes the process of running CLUE experiments on the selected SUT.

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Docker, e.g. 20.10
- Kubernetes, e.g. 1.29 (for testing purposes, [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) works)
  - at least one Kubernetes node running Scaphandra/[Kepler](https://sustainable-computing.io/installation/kepler-helm/), and a [NodeExporter](https://observability.thomasriley.co.uk/monitoring-kubernetes/metrics/node-exporter/). If the tracker does not find any energy data, the experiment will start, but the script will stop due to lack of usable insights
  - for the serverless variant, knative installed
  - for external power meters, connect e.g. a Tapo device (out of scope of this Readme)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/), e.g. v3.16
- Python, e.g. 3.11, using uv in this Readme

## 🚀 System setup

> [!CAUTION]
> Please note that this repository also contains work in progress parts -- not all CLUE features and experiment branches that are not mentioned in the paper might be thoroughly tested.

### 1. 🏁 Setting up the image registry

The docker image registry used by CLUE can be specified in the `clue-config.yaml` file (`docker_registry_address` parameter). By default, CLUE supports deploying a local image registry listed below. To deploy the local registry, make sure `Docker` (with `Docker Compose` support) is installed and running. For a custom registry, make sure to run `docker login` in case authentication is needed.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Update the `Docker Deamon` configuration to allow insecure connections to the deployed image registry (e.g. at /etc/docker/daemon.json). For `Docker Desktop` go to the configuration and the `Docker Engine` tab and append the following option:

```json
  "insecure-registries": [
    "host.minikube.internal:6789"
  ]
```

You may need to restart docker to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Make sure that `Minikube` (or your other choosen local kubernets cluster) accepts the registry as well and has enough memory (configure docker before). In case you already have created a minikube cluster before make sure to delete if and recreate it using this command:

```bash
minikube start --cni=flannel --insecure-registry "host.minikube.internal:6789" --cpus 8 --memory 12000
```

Also add an additional node to allow running the loadgenerator (which can not run on the same node as the experiment itself):

```bash
minikube node add
```

### 2. 🛠️ CLUE2 setup

Clone the system under test, i.e. the teastore.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ISE-TU-Berlin/sustainable_teastore.git teastore
```

For local development, clone the PSC tracker into `agent` (uv is configured in the toml to find it there):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ISE-TU-Berlin/PSC.git agent
```

Install Python dependencies using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (or use a virtual environment with e.g. pipenv)

```bash
uv sync
```

In a multi-node setting, not all nodes might have the option to measure using scaphandre, so Clue ensures that only appropiate nodes are assigned with experiment pods. To simulate this for, e.g., the minikube node, apply a label:

```bash
kubectl label nodes minikube scaphandre=true
```

### 3. 🧱 SUT Build

Before running CLUE2, all images of the selected SUT have to be built and stored in the specified image registry. The image registry path `docker_registry_address` can be changed in the main config (by default, CLUE uses the registry deployed in previous steps).

To build images for the `TeaStore`, use the command listed below. By default the script builds images for all experiments.

```bash
uv run clue-builders/teastore/build.py
```

To specify a single experiment to be build append the `--exp EXPERIMENT_NAME` flag.

### 4. 🧪 SUT Test Deployment

For a test deployment of the SUT (without running the CLUE2, nor the workload generator), run the following command. Make sure that all required images are present in the specified image registry.

```bash
uv run clue-deployer/run.py --sut teastore --exp-name baseline
```

, where the `--sut` is the name of the SUT config inside of the `sut_configs` directory, and the `--exp-name` is the name of the branch containing the desired experiment.

When deploying `Teastore` while using minikube, forward a port so you can test and access the TeaStore:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/teastore-webui 8080:80 --namespace=tea-bench
```

TeaStore may run some initial tasks on startup, so make sure to wait a minute if is slow / unavailable.

### 5. 💨 CLUE2 Deployment

To run the main CLUE2, run the task below. Make sure that all required images are present in the specified image registry.
The following command runs clue with the teastore as the SUT.

```bash
uv run clue-deployer/main.py
```

### 6. 📋 (Optional) CLUE2 Deployment with local

If you create your own variants or make changes to the SUT, the images need to be rebuilt and pushed to the image registry specified in the config. Make sure to run `docker login` in case authentication is needed.

If all the preliminaries for data collection are installed, Clue will fetch the relevant measuremens from Prometheus and save them into the data folder. For data analysis, we provide Python notebooks seperately.

## 💻 Troubleshooting / Known Issues

- When using docker desktop, enable in settings > advanced: _Allow the default Docker socket to be used_
- Ensure that you have a sufficient amount of memory alocated for docker, at least 12 GB
- Run `minikube dashboard` to monitor deployment errors, e.g. missing node labels or insufficient memory
- The monolith app has some specific handles, e.g. a different set name. If a a set is not found, especially when skipping builds, this can cause probelems
